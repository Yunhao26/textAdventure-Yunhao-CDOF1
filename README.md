## Developer Guide

If you want to contribute new story paths or endings:

- Main logic is in `main.py`
- Each path (e.g., `forest_path()`, `highway_path()`) is a function
- You can create a new function and link it via `input()` options
- Be sure to test the flow from start to finish

## Game Story Overview

You wake up alone in a mysterious, dark forest.  
Two paths stretch before you: a narrow trail disappearing into thick trees and a wide, strangely quiet road.

As you explore, your choices lead you to different fates:
- Befriending a small fox who may lead you to something magical
- Finding an old cabin where an elderly woman offers helpâ€¦ or is she hiding something?
- Getting lost in the woods and chased by wolves
- Collapsing from exhaustion after wandering endlessly

### Planned & Possible Future Story Branches:

We are planning to expand the story in the following directions:

- **The Abandoned Village**: A hidden path leads to a ruined village haunted by shadows of the past. Will you investigate or run?
- **The Talking Tree**: Deep in the forest stands a tree that whispers secrets. Answer its riddles to unlock new paths.
- **The River Crossing**: A dangerous river blocks your path. Do you build a raft, wait for help, or swim across?
- **Inventory & Choices**: Collect items like a lantern, map, or food along the way. Your inventory may change what paths are available later.
- **Moral Decisions**: Help or ignore creatures in need. Your kindness (or cruelty) may affect your ending.

The game is designed to be modular and expandable. New contributors are encouraged to add paths, encounters, items, or even a branching map system.

Let your imagination guide the story!
